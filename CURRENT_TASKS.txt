- in upgrading consumer account, the uplink can change from the system account to the new broker who
  convinced the tenant/consumer to join the main ghfu system. revert changes in terms of "children" in
  the previous system uplink account and add the consumer account to the new uplink's children...
  A lot of shit can go wrong here so take extra fucking care!
- update save/load structure functions to accomodate consumer-account details
